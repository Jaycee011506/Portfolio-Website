      Economic education focuses on the scholarship of teaching and learning economics as a subject. It encompasses the content to be taught, methods of teaching, evaluation of those methods,
      and information of general interest to teachers of economics in elementary through graduate school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economic education is extremely important because it is vital to the future health of our nation's economy. The purpose of economic education is to create responsible citizens and effective decision-makers. 
      Economic education is a very crucial subject that many of our nation's schools tend to overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of economic education goes far beyond the goal of improving an understanding of the basic principles of supply and demand. Economics can be taught by exposing students to real-life learning environments and experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students develop perceptions of their economic world at an early age. As they progress through the educational process, these perceptions develop into attitudes and opinions. Teachers influence the direction of this attitude development.
    </p>
    <p>
      By teaching students more about economics, teachers contribute to improved attitudes toward the subject. Teaching basic economic concepts and applying them in discussions builds a knowledge foundation for informed opinions and decisions. 
      Students who never get this opportunity may never take interest in economics or their economic world.
