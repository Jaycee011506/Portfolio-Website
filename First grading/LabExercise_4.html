        <p>
          Economic education focuses on the scholarship of teaching and learning economics as a subject. It encompasses the content to be taught, methods of teaching, evaluation of those methods, and information of general interest to teachers of economics in elementary through graduate school. Economic education is extremely important because it is vital to the future health of our nation's economy. The purpose of economic education is to create responsible citizens and effective decision makers. Economic education is a very crucial subject that many of our nation's schools tend to overlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance of economic education goes far beyond the goal of improving an understanding of the basic principles of supply and demand and the workings of the economy. Economics can be taught by generating new knowledge with the help of exposing students to real-life learning environments and experiences. Students develop perceptions of their economic world at an early age, which, as they progress through the educational process, develop into attitudes and opinions about the subject of economics. Intended or not, teachers influence the direction of attitude development. By finding ways to teach students more about economics, teachers are contributing to improved attitudes toward the subject. By teaching basic economic concepts and applying them to classroom discussions of economic issues and institutions, teachers and lecturers are not indoctrinating students, but providing a knowledge foundation for more informed student opinions and decision making on vital economic issues. The more economic concepts students know, the more they like and value the subject and the more information they have about economic issues. Students who do not get the opportunity to learn economics and increase their economic understanding will probably never take much interest in the subject or in their economic world.
